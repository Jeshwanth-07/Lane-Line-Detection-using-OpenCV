# Lane-Line-Detection-using-OpenCV
A real-time computer vision project that detects lane lines from road video footage using Python and OpenCV. It uses Canny edge detection, region masking, and Hough Transform to identify and overlay lane lines on each video frame. Ideal for understanding the basics of autonomous driving systems and real-time video processing.
